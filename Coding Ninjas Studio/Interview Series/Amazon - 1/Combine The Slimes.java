Problem Statement:
Steve has 'N' slimes. Each slime has a size between O to 99. He wants to convert all these slimes into one slime but he can only mix two adjacent slimes at one time. On mixing two slimes of size 'a' and 'b' the size of the slime becomes a+b and the cost of mixing two slimes is a*b. But if he mixes two slimes and the size becomes greater than or equal to 100, the slime gets unstable and loses its size by 100. le. the size of slime becomes a+b mod 100. Help Steve to find the minimum cost in mixing for mixing all these slimes.
